This chapter illustrates how the patterns in this book can be used to solve a variety of integration
problems. In order to do so, we examine common integration scenarios and present a
comprehensive integration example. As we design the solution to this example, we will express
the solution using the patterns contained in this book. At the end of this chapter you will be
familiar with about two dozen integration patterns.
